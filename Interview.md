## 1- You have two identical rops, one rop can burn in 60 min, but burnning pattern is irregular mean maybe first half of the rop can be burn in 50 min and other half can be in 10 min, you have to calculate 45 min using the ropes.
```
Burn rope#1 from both sides and rope#2 just from one side. The first rope will be burnt in 30 minutes as per the conditions.
At that time burn the rope#2 from the second side and after 15 minutes second rope will be burnt out and 
we have 45 minutes calculated
```
## 2- Finding Even Odd number without condition
### Note: It is a psuedo code so there can be syntax errors
```
const arr = ["Even", "Odd"]  //The positions of even and odd can't be changes as even=0 and odd=1
cin >> n;
cout << arr[n % 2]
```
## 3- Pillars of OOP
```
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
```
## 4- Difference between abstract class and interface
```
An abstract class allows you to define the functionalities that can be implemented by the subclasses.
Whereas the interface just allows you to define the functionalities and there is no implementation.
```

## 5- Access Modifiers Vs Access Specifiers
```
There is no difference between the access modifiers and access specifiers. They both are same. The access
modifiers is just a new term used instead of access specifiers.
Acces modifiers are the keywords i.e., private, protected, public
```
